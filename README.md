## ‚ö° Quick Demo

A preconfigured patient is available for demo purposes.  

1. **Go to the Patient Page**  
   - Project ID, Dataset Name, and FHIR Store Name are prefilled in the demo.  
   - Patient ID is also prefilled for convenience.  

2. **Add a Diagnosis or Allergy**  
   - Enter a clinical status, code, and description (for diagnosis) OR type in an allergy (e.g. *Cashew nuts*).  
   - Click **Upload**.  

3. **Refresh the page**  
   - Your newly added entry will appear under the patient‚Äôs records.  

üëâ Note: You may use your own GCS credentials or please contact me for the blocked out projectID to test on your own machine! Email: jushendhillon@gmail.com

### üß™ Try the Converter Page

You can also test the **CSV/JSON ‚Üí FHIR conversion** feature using the sample files provided in the repo root:

- Download csvToFhir in repo root and upload on `/convertPage` to see how CSV data is mapped to FHIR.  
- Download jsonToFhir in repo root and upload on `/convertPage` to convert JSON directly into FHIR resources.  

After uploading either file, you‚Äôll see the converted **FHIR Bundle** displayed in the app.

## üîí Usage Policy

This project is for **portfolio/demo purposes only**.  
- The backend restricts creation of new FHIR stores/datasets to prevent abuse and excessive billing.  
- You can only interact with the preconfigured demo patient record.  
- If you want to adapt this for production, you‚Äôll need your own Google Cloud project + Healthcare API setup.
